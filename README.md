# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
The Gaming Room is the client looking to expand their game, "Draw It or Lose It," from Android to a web-based application. They need a web app that can support multiple teams and players, with each game instance having a unique identifier. Some key requirements include a RESTful API for game interactions and user logins, Basic Authentication for security, scalability for future updates, and a design that works across both desktop and mobile platforms. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 
I effectively organized the documentation, clearly outlining the requirements and constraints while ensuring that technical details were accessible. This structured approach helped facilitate better communication among team members. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 
Working through the design document allowed me to clarify the application’s architecture and identify potential challenges early on. This proactive approach helped simplify the coding phase, as I had a clear roadmap to follow. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
If I could revise one part of the documentation, it would be the section on security measures. I would expand it to include more detailed explanations of encryption methods and potential security threats. This would enhance understanding and ensure that all team members are aligned on security best practices. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
I gathered user needs through feedback and discussions, ensuring that features like team management and unique identifiers were prioritized. Considering users’ needs is crucial, as it directly impacts their experience and satisfaction with the application. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 
I approached the software design by using a modular strategy, breaking the application down into manageable components. In future projects, I would employ techniques like user story mapping and prototyping to further analyze requirements and iterate on design effectively. This would allow for more user-centered solutions and quicker identification of potential issues.
